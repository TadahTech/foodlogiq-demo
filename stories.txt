As an API consumer, I want a REST API to create an event
As an API consumer, I want a REST API that I can pass a JSON document representing an event to. The API will validate the data structure and data provided.
    If the data represents a well-formed event, then the event must be persisted and success is returned.
    If the data is not a well-formed event, then the event is not persisted and an error is returned.

    Acceptance Criteria
        If the user authentication fails, return an authentication failure status code
        REST API is built that accepts JSON document
        Required values must be provided and are validated
        Derived values are applied before the event is stored
        If the optional date values are provided within the contents, the date values are validated as dates
        If all data is provided successfully, store the event internally and return an appropriate success status code
        If there are any errors, return an error message about the error and an appropriate failure status code

-------------------------------------------------

As an API consumer, I want a REST API to delete a specific event
Build a REST API that will attempt to remove access to an event. Due to audit constraints, we cannot just remove data from the platform. Instead,  if a user wants to remove data, it is soft deleted so that the information can be filtered out in the other APIs.
    Acceptance Criteria
        If the user authentication fails, return an authentication failure status code
        If the supplied event ID does not exist, return an appropriate failure status code
        If the supplied event ID does exist, but not accessible by the user, return an appropriate failure status code
        If the supplied event ID does exist and is accessible by the user, mark the event as deleted and return an appropriate success status  code
        If the event has already been deleted, consider it a success

---------------------------------------------

As an API consumer, I want a REST API to retrieve a specific event
Build a REST API that will list a specific event given an ID value. You are building a multi-tenant REST API, so only return the data if the user  who is requesting the data is also the user who created the data.
    Acceptance Criteria
        If the user authentication fails, return an authentication failure status code
        If the ID provided is not found, return an appropriate failure status code
        If the ID provided is found, but was not created by the user who is making the REST API call, return the same failure as if the ID was not  found
        If the event of the ID has been deleted, return the same failure as if the ID was not found
        If the ID provided is found and the user making the REST API call also created the event, then return the event.

---------------------------------------------

As an API consumer, I want a REST API to list all of my events
Build a REST API that will retrieve and list all events that the current user has access to. The API shall return a list of events (or an empty list) for  the user. The events should be sorted based on the createdAt datetime with the newest events first.
    Acceptance Criteria
        If the user authentication fails, return an authentication failure status code
        If the user has no events, return an empty list
        If the user has events, return the list of events sorted based on createdAt with the newest events first
        If any of the events have been deleted, do not return them in the results

As an DevOps engineer, I want to deploy this project utilizing docker / docker-compose
At FoodLogiQ, out platform utilizes docker containers to run. This ensures the code is portable across servers and operating systems. For this  project, create a docker container that will assemble your REST API and any required resources. If you are utilizing additional services such as a  database or web server, then also a docker-compose file that will start up and connect all of the dependent services with each other.
    Acceptance Criteria
        Create a Dockerfile that will build and assemble your REST service
        If additional services are utilized, also include a docker-compose.yml file to ensure all services are wired up correctly Create a Makefile that can be used to simplify how to assemble your project
